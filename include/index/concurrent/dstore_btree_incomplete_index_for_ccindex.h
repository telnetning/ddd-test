     * the deletion rollback.
     *
     * Note 2. The deletion MERGE may also fail to find its deleting target if the insertion of the target was
     * also recorded in the DeltaDmlTable, and the final operation -- the deletion we're dealing with -- can
     * be kept. For this case, since the deletion is already committed and visible to all, we can just skip merging.

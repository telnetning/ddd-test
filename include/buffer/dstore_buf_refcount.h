    * Backend-Private refcount management:
    *
    * Each buffer also has a private refcount that keeps track of the number of
    * times the buffer is pinned in the current process.  This is so that the
    * shared refcount needs to be modified only once if a buffer is pinned more
    * than once by a individual backend.  It's also used to check that no buffers
    * are still pinned at the end of transactions and when exiting.
    *
    *
    * To avoid - as we used to - requiring an array with g_storageInstance.attr.attr_storage.NBuffers entries to keep
    * track of local buffers we use a small sequentially searched array
    * (PrivateRefCountArray) and a overflow hash table (PrivateRefCountHash) to
    * keep track of backend local pins.
    *
    * Until no more than REFCOUNT_ARRAY_ENTRIES buffers are pinned at once, all
    * refcounts are kept track of in the array; after that, new array entries
    * displace old ones into the hash table. That way a frequently used entry
    * can't get "stuck" in the hashtable while infrequent ones clog the array.
    *
    * Note that in most scenarios the number of pinned buffers will not exceed
    * REFCOUNT_ARRAY_ENTRIES.

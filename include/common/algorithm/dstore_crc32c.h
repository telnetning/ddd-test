 * Description:
 * The speed of CRC-32C calculation has a big impact on performance, so we
 * jump through some hoops to get the best implementation for each
 * platform. Some CPU architectures have special instructions for speeding
 * up CRC calculations (e.g. Intel SSE 4.2), on other platforms we use the
 * Slicing-by-8 algorithm which uses lookup tables.
 *
 * The public interface consists of four macros:
 *
 * COMP_CRC32C(crc, data, len)
 *		Accumulate some (more) bytes into a CRC
 *
 * FIN_CRC32C(crc)
 *		Finish a CRC calculation
